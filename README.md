# üõ°Ô∏è University Financial Portal - Threat Modeling Project

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) This repository presents a comprehensive threat model for a University Financial Portal, designed using Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool (TMT). The project evaluates potential risks and proposes mitigation strategies to secure the communication, authentication, and data flow across student and staff user environments.

## üß© Project Overview

The system allows students and internal staff to securely interact with a financial server through a web portal:

* **Students:** Authenticate using a dedicated Active Directory (AD) domain within a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) network segment.
* **Internal Staff:** Access the system through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or a secure internal network.

The threat model focuses on the architecture and potential vulnerabilities associated with the new student web portal and its interaction with the existing financial system.

## üîê System Features & Security Objectives (Based on Requirements)

1.  **Student Web Portal Implementation:**
    * Secure web-based portal for university students.
    * Secure communication over HTTPS (no VPN required for students).
    * Student authentication via a separate Active Directory (AD) domain.

2.  **Student Portal Functionalities:**
    * View current balance.
    * Access payment history.
    * Set up payment accounts.
    * Make one-time payments.
    * Set up automatic payments.

3.  **Existing Financial System Features:**
    * Staff access via internal network or secure web portal (VPN required).
    * Encrypted internal network traffic between user workstations, application servers, and databases.
    * Encrypted database records for sensitive data.
    * Staff authentication via Active Directory.
    * Application access control using AD Security Group Policy Objects (GPOs).

4.  **Technical Setup:**
    * Web portal server hosted within the data center's DMZ.
    * Encrypted connections between the web portal and internal resources (domain controllers and other servers).
    * Dedicated Student AD Domain Controller within the DMZ for student credential validation.

## üß† Threat Modeling (Based on TMT Diagrams)

Conducted using Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool. The diagrams illustrate the data flow and security boundaries within the system. Key components analyzed include:

* **Student User Interaction:** Accessing the web portal through browsers.
* **Proxy Server:** Handling student requests and potentially providing a layer of security.
* **Student AD Domain Controller:** Authenticating student users.
* **Financial Server:** Hosting sensitive financial data and business logic.
* **Internal Staff Interaction:** Accessing the financial system via internal network or VPN.
* **Internal AD:** Managing staff authentication and authorization.
* **Authorization Provider:** Likely involved in controlling access to financial resources.
* **Web Server Cache:** Potentially storing temporary data.
* **Cookies:** Used for session management.
* **Databases:** Storing financial data and potentially user information.

**Identified Potential Threat Areas (Based on Image 1 - Fault Tree Analysis):**

The fault tree analysis in Image 1 focuses on the high-level goal of "Steal Financial Data" and outlines potential attack paths:

* **Hack Financial Database:**
    * **Authorized Access:** Malicious internal staff.
    * **Unauthorized Access:**
        * Bypassing Authentication (e.g., Stolen Cookie, Leaked Username/Password).
        * Physical Access (Direct Access to workstations, Left-open Workstations, Directly installing malware).
* **Intercept Communication:**
    * Phishing attacks.
    * SSL/TLS Stripping (Downgrading encryption).
    * Packet Sniffing (Capturing network traffic).
        * Connecting from an infected device.
        * Connecting through an unsafe network/public Wi-Fi.

**Identified Key Data Flows and Components (Based on Image 2 - Data Flow Diagram):**

The Data Flow Diagram (DFD) in Image 2 provides a detailed view of the system's components and how data moves between them. Key elements include:

* **External Entities:** Students and Internal Staff.
* **Processes:** Web Client (Student Browser), Proxy Server, Student AD, Financial Server, Internal AD, Authorization Provider, IT Management Server.
* **Data Stores:** Cookies (Student & Staff), Web Server Cache, Financial Database, AD Databases (Student & Internal).
* **Data Flows:** Depicting requests, responses, authentication data, financial data, and management information.
* **Security Boundaries:** Clearly demarcating the University Network, Internal Network, and DMZ.

**Observed Security Measures (Based on Requirements and Diagrams):**

* Use of HTTPS for student portal communication.
* Separate AD domains for students and staff.
* Placement of the web portal in the DMZ.
* Encrypted connections between web portal and internal resources.
* VPN requirement for staff accessing the portal externally.
* Encryption of internal network traffic and database records.
* Use of firewalls (Internal and External are implied by the network boundaries).
* Proxy server for the student portal.

**Important Considerations and Potential Updates:**

* **Threat Mitigation Strategies:** The table in the README provides initial thoughts. You should expand this significantly based on the detailed findings in your TMT report. Include specific technical controls and processes that can mitigate the identified threats.
* **TMT Report:** If the `Report for TMT.htm` file contains detailed information about threats, vulnerabilities, and suggested mitigations, consider including it in the repository. You might also want to extract key findings from it and summarize them more concisely in the README.
* **Diagram Clarity:** Ensure the screenshots of your TMT diagrams are clear and easy to understand. If possible, consider exporting them in a higher resolution or as a different image format if it improves readability.
* **Further Analysis:** As you continue to work on this project, you might identify new threats or refine your mitigation strategies. Keep the README updated to reflect the latest state of your threat model.
* **Consider a Dedicated Threat Report File:** If the mitigation strategies become extensive, you might want to create a separate document (e.g., `Threat_Report.md` or `Threat_Report.docx`) to keep the README concise.

By following these steps, you'll have a well-structured and informative GitHub repository for your University Financial Portal threat modeling project. Remember to continuously update it as your understanding evolves. Let me know if you have any other questions!
