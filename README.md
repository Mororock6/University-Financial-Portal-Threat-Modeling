# University Financial Portal Threat Model

**Repository Name:** University-Financial-Portal-Threat-Modeling

## Description

A comprehensive threat model for a University Financial Portal, designed using the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool (TMT). This model focuses on securing communication, authentication, and data flow for both students and staff interacting with the financial system. The system integrates an existing internal financial platform with a newly developed web-based portal for students, emphasizing secure and straightforward access to financial services through modern security practices like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and encrypted connections.

## System Overview

The project encompasses:

* **Student Web Portal**: A new web-based portal for university students enabling secure HTTPS access (no VPN) for functionalities like viewing balances, payment history, managing payment accounts, and making payments. Student authentication is handled by a dedicated Active Directory (AD) domain.
* **Existing Financial System**: Accessed by staff via the internal network or a secure web portal (VPN required). Features include encrypted internal network traffic, encrypted database records for sensitive data, and staff authentication managed via a separate staff/faculty AD and GPO for application access.
* **Technical Setup**:
    * The student web portal server is located in the data centerâ€™s DMZ.
    * A Student AD Domain Controller is also implemented within the DMZ for student credential validation.
    * Encrypted connections are mandated between the web portal and internal resources (domain controllers, other servers).

## Threat Model Details

    * Data flows between DMZ components (Web Portal, Student AD) and internal university resources.
* **Current Status (as of 5/14/2025 report)**:
    * **Total Threats Identified**: 214
    * **Mitigation Implemented**: 16
    * **Not Started**: 198
    * **Needs Investigation**: 0
    * **Not Applicable**: 0
    *(This highlights a significant number of identified threats that require mitigation strategies.)*
* **Assumptions**:
    * Proxy and VPN Servers are operating on the Linux kernel.

## Repository Contents

This repository aims to store all relevant files for the University Financial Portal threat model. It should include:

* `Report for TMT.htm`: The detailed threat model report generated by the TMT.
* `Threat_Model_Diagram.jpg` (or similar name for "Screenshot 2025-05-13 234455.jpg"): The visual diagram of the system architecture and threat model.
* `Attack_Tree.drawio.png` (or similar name for "Copy of Attack Tree.drawio.png"): The attack tree diagram.
* The Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool file (e.g., `.tm7` file if available) for the "University Financial System" model.
* This `README.md` file.

## Future Work / Areas for Attention

Given the current status of the threat model where 198 out of 214 threats are marked as "Not Started" for mitigation (), future work should focus on:

* Developing and implementing mitigation strategies for the identified threats, prioritizing high-risk items.
* Regularly reviewing and updating the threat model as the system evolves.
